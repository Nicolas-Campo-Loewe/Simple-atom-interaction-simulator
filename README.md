Includes dipole moments and kinetic energy (adjusted by temperature via up/down keys). 

Bonds are formed to complete the valence layer. They can be covalent, ionic or metallic depending on the electronegativity, as well as simple, double or triple. Bond strength depends on this variables.

Adjust variables in "chemistry.py" and "physics.py"
